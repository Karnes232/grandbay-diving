    paragraph:
      "It is a popular tourist destination and place frequented by some cruises ships of the Caribbean. Recommended activities on Catalina Island: snorkeling and diving, given the nature of its translucent waters and surrounded by live coral living in colorful fish. Isla Catalina, is an ideal option to take as an excursion if you are spending your vacations in La Romana, Punta Cana.",
    paragraph2:
      "THE WALL: This spectacular drop-off is definitely one of the best dive sites in the Dominican Republic. A gentle slope leads towards the wall. On the top reef you will enjoy the abundant marine life. Every square centimeter of this sea bed is covered with sponges and hard or soft coral. The depth of this terrace varies from 1.5 to 6 meters. The drop-off is fully overgrown with coral and the crevices hide a tremendous amount of reef creatures. We restrict the depth even for advanced divers to 30 meters.",
    paragraph3:
      "THE AQUARIUM: The dive site is protected from the wind. Year round perfect conditions at the surface guarantee a very easy dive at about 12 meters depth. Incredibly healthy coral formations await you on the almost flat sandy bottom. Yellow stingrays, lobsters, moray eels, angelfish, grunts, snappers, soldier fish and trunkfish are only part of its attraction. Huge vase and barrel sponges hide stone crabs and “sea spiders”. You will see trumpet fish trying to blend in with the branches of soft coral formations.",

    paragraph2:
      "Located just a half-mile off the coast of Dominicus in Bayahíbe, the 73-meter (240 feet) long St. George ship was originally built in 1962 in Scotland, and was used to transport wheat and barley from Europe to the Caribbean. Today, the sunken ship is home to barracudas, moray eels, king mackerels, and groupers, among other species. Due to its depth of 40 meters (131 feet), it is recommended only for advanced divers.",
    paragraph3:
      "The small fishing village of Bayahibe is located on the south coast of the Dominican Republic, a great place to visit any time of the year. Scuba diving in Bayahibe, is probably the best scuba diving on the whole Island. Diving in Bayahibe is generally easy. Most of the reefs just offshore and the protected side of Saona Island have little to no current.",
